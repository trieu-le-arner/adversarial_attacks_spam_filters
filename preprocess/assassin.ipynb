On the employment situation... it seems that a lot of applied cryptographers are currently unemployed (Tim Dierks, Joseph, a few ex-colleagues, and friends who asked if I had any leads, the spate of recent \\\"security consultant\\\" .sigs, plus I heard that a straw poll of attenders at the codecon conference earlier this year showed close to 50% out of work). Are there any more definitive security industry stats? Are applied crypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general application programmers? (From my statistically too small sample of acquaintances it might appear so.) If this is so, why is it? - you might think the physical security push following the world political instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied by a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies improving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec plans. - governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national information infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security Czar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought to do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's best to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws) - even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's security act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium which I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control points and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play for the home entertainment system space with DRM) However these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by: - dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though there is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term unemployment rates were not that elevated in general) - perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first things to be canned when cash runs short? - software security related contract employees laid off ahead of full-timers? Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and especially in crypto software contracts look few and far between. At least in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not familiar with north america). - PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated expectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI companies downsizing. (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption of broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509 delayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was strictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I think significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of the broken tech, people will just do something else.) - custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps weighted towards dot-coms that just crashed. - big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers with no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging) most of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly contributing to the crappy state of crypto in software. So probably failure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of financial incentives to care on the part of software developers. Microsoft is really good at this one. The number of times they re-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing! Other explanations? Statistics? Sample-of-one stories? Adam -- yes, still employed in sofware security industry; and in addition have been doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if you have any interesting applied crypto projects; reference commissions paid. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork \\\"\",\n          \"\\\"So, a new family moved in down the street, with two kids, making us very excited that there might be a child around the same age (20 months) as our daughter Tatum.

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day\\\\nof the deadline for companies to certify their financial\\\\nstatements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited\\\\nfor the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words\\\\ntomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave \\\\nthe commission its latest layoff numbers.\\\\n\\\\nIBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings\\\\nreport, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope.\\\\n(\\\\\\\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\\\\\\\") Only after\\\\n\\\\\\\"months of surreptitious layoff notices\\\\\\\" did the company admit\\\\nthat it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's\\\\nabout 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. \\\\nAn IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher\\\\nnumber was due to \\\\\\\"rebalancing\\\\\\\" and more employees than expected \\\\ntaking voluntary layoffs. \\\\n\\\\nSorry, we're still back on \\\\\\\"rebalancing.\\\\\\\" Did IBM \\\\\\\"rightsize\\\\\\\"\\\\nlast quarter, too?\\\\n\\\\nIBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some\\\\ndetails were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's\\\\nmicroelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT\\\\nservices and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees \\\\nfrom PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)\\\\nLook for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such\\\\nas Austin and Raleigh. \\\\n\\\\nOK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're\\\\nstill tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so\\\\nbad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting\\\\nregulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \\\\\\\"stealth\\\\nlayoffs,\\\\\\\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced\\\\nit to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the\\\\nlatest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give\\\\nspecifics.

Now Vivendi Universal's top\\\\nman has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced\\\\ntoday that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle \\\\nup some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book\\\\npublisher Houghton Mifflin. \\\\n\\\\nIt's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine\\\\nturnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply\\\\nfollowing the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe\\\\n$18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian\\\\nreported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when\\\\ninvestors got the willies about the company's impending\\\\nannouncement on its financial health. But the company had\\\\npositive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first \\\\nhalf was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7%\\\\nboost. \\\\n\\\\nDetails are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring\\\\nefforts, with more information expected at the next board\\\\nmeeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton\\\\nMifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague\\\\nexplanation that included the \\\\\\\"Curious George\\\\\\\" character, were\\\\nthe only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian\\\\nspeculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games\\\\nbusiness and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone\\\\ncompany SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates,\\\\naccording to the newspaper. \\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues\\\\nto advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources\\\\nsay Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough\\\\nto let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan\\\\nabode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an\\\\nunrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the\\\\nMediterranean.

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.</P><P>\\\\nIBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (\\\\\\\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\\\\\\\") Only after \\\\\\\"months of surreptitious layoff notices\\\\\\\" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to \\\\\\\"rebalancing\\\\\\\" and more employees than\\\\nexpected taking voluntary layoffs. </P><P>\\\\nSorry, we're still back on \\\\\\\"rebalancing.\\\\\\\" Did IBM \\\\\\\"rightsize\\\\\\\" last quarter, too?</P><P>\\\\nIBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. </P><P>\\\\nOK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \\\\\\\"stealth layoffs,\\\\\\\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics.

Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin. </P><P>\\\\nIt's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first half was \\\\nup 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost. </P><P>\\\\nDetails are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the \\\\\\\"Curious George\\\\\\\" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable\\\\nsale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper. </P><P>\\\\nMeanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean.

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day\\\\nof the deadline for companies to certify their financial\\\\nstatements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited\\\\nfor the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words\\\\ntomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave \\\\nthe commission its latest layoff numbers.\\\\n\\\\nIBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings\\\\nreport, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope.\\\\n(\\\\\\\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\\\\\\\") Only after\\\\n\\\\\\\"months of surreptitious layoff notices\\\\\\\" did the company admit\\\\nthat it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's\\\\nabout 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. \\\\nAn IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher\\\\nnumber was due to \\\\\\\"rebalancing\\\\\\\" and more employees than expected \\\\ntaking voluntary layoffs. \\\\n\\\\nSorry, we're still back on \\\\\\\"rebalancing.\\\\\\\" Did IBM \\\\\\\"rightsize\\\\\\\"\\\\nlast quarter, too?\\\\n\\\\nIBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some\\\\ndetails were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's\\\\nmicroelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT\\\\nservices and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees \\\\nfrom PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)\\\\nLook for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such\\\\nas Austin and Raleigh. \\\\n\\\\nOK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're\\\\nstill tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so\\\\nbad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting\\\\nregulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \\\\\\\"stealth\\\\nlayoffs,\\\\\\\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced\\\\nit to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the\\\\nlatest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give\\\\nspecifics.

Now Vivendi Universal's top\\\\nman has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced\\\\ntoday that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle \\\\nup some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book\\\\npublisher Houghton Mifflin. \\\\n\\\\nIt's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine\\\\nturnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply\\\\nfollowing the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe\\\\n$18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian\\\\nreported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when\\\\ninvestors got the willies about the company's impending\\\\nannouncement on its financial health. But the company had\\\\npositive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first \\\\nhalf was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7%\\\\nboost. \\\\n\\\\nDetails are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring\\\\nefforts, with more information expected at the next board\\\\nmeeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton\\\\nMifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague\\\\nexplanation that included the \\\\\\\"Curious George\\\\\\\" character, were\\\\nthe only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian\\\\nspeculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games\\\\nbusiness and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone\\\\ncompany SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates,\\\\naccording to the newspaper. \\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues\\\\nto advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources\\\\nsay Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough\\\\nto let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan\\\\nabode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an\\\\nunrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the\\\\nMediterranean.

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.</P><P>\\\\nIBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (\\\\\\\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\\\\\\\") Only after \\\\\\\"months of surreptitious layoff notices\\\\\\\" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to \\\\\\\"rebalancing\\\\\\\" and more employees than\\\\nexpected taking voluntary layoffs. </P><P>\\\\nSorry, we're still back on \\\\\\\"rebalancing.\\\\\\\" Did IBM \\\\\\\"rightsize\\\\\\\" last quarter, too?</P><P>\\\\nIBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. </P><P>\\\\nOK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \\\\\\\"stealth layoffs,\\\\\\\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics.

Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin. </P><P>\\\\nIt's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first half was \\\\nup 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost. </P><P>\\\\nDetails are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the \\\\\\\"Curious George\\\\\\\" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable\\\\nsale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper. </P><P>\\\\nMeanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean.
